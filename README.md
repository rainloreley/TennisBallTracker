# TennisBallTracker

A "simple" program intended to track a tennis ball and drawing a parabola while throwing it.
More information coming soon (probably - it's for school).

You need to place a .mlmodel file called "TennisBallDetector.mlmodel" inside "BallTrackerMacOS". Otherwise, it won't work. And it uses the OBS Virtual Camera to get an input, you can change that if you want to.

This is not really intended to be used by anyone except me, I uploaded it here because maybe, just maybe, someone finds it useful or if not, at least I have a backup.

## Questions

If you have any questions (why would you?), feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leabmgrt2), [E-Mail](mailto:lea@abmgrt.dev) or open an issue. I do not plan to continue this project after I used it in school though.
